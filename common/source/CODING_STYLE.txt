# Coding style

The coding style for MMD C and C++ code is based on LLVM coding style in order
to support consistency with other projects in the oneAPI software stack. The
style is documented at LLVM website: https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html
however, some requirements may by LLVM specific. For MMD purposes the most
important thing is to conform to the conventions that are enforced by
clang-format.

Code should be formatted using clang-format with included style file that
is based on LLVM style. Code that is committed to repository should not change
when clang-format is applied. In the event that changes to LLVM coding
convention result in code churn the .clang-format file may be modified.

For cases where clang-format produces unacceptable results directives should
be added to instruct clang-format to skip these blocks of code. The 
directives are:

// clang-format off
code to be skipped
// clang-format on

Code that is not formatted by clang-format should be minimized.

To apply clang-format on files that you edit run the command

clang-format -i <filename>
